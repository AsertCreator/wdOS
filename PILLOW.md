# Pillow
Simple JavaScript-orientated runtime and bytecode written in C#. 
Bundled with Weirdo - JavaScript-like programming language. Pillow
Runtime is the reference implementation of its bytecode. Bytecode 
is made in such a way, that you can make runtime for it on another
programming language and make compilers for it.

### Development State
Currently project is at version 0.1.0. It's in alpha state, but it
already can run programs. Weirdo Compiler is somewhat functional too.
